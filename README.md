## 💻 Development Workflow

1. Each topic has its own Cargo project
2. Regular commits with meaningful messages
3. Comprehensive documentation for each concept
4. Practice exercises and real-world projects
5. Code reviews and refactoring sessions

## 🔧 Git Workflow

Quick reference for Git commands:

```bash
# Quick status check
git status

# Stage and commit in one go
git commit -am "Your message here"

# Push changes to remote
git push origin main

# Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b feature-name
```

## 📝 Progress Tracking

- Each project includes its own README with:
  - Concepts covered
  - Learning objectives
  - Implementation notes
  - Challenges faced and solutions
- Regular progress updates
- Code review notes
- Performance improvements

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Master Rust programming fundamentals
- Understand memory safety and ownership
- Build production-ready applications
- Implement best practices in Rust
- Contribute to open source projects
- Develop systems programming skills
