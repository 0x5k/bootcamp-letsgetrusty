# 🦀 Rust Programming Bootcamp

A comprehensive 9-month journey into Rust programming language, from basics to advanced concepts.

## 📚 Course Structure

The bootcamp is divided into three main learning phases:

### 1. Beginner Topics (Months 1-3)
- Rust basics and syntax
- Variables and data types
- Control flow
- Functions and modules
- Basic error handling
- Ownership and borrowing fundamentals
- Basic structs and enums

### 2. Intermediate Topics (Months 4-6)
- Advanced ownership concepts
- Lifetimes
- Advanced error handling
- Traits and generics
- Testing and documentation
- Concurrency basics
- Standard library deep dive

### 3. Advanced Topics (Months 7-9)
- Advanced concurrency
- Unsafe Rust
- FFI and system integration
- Advanced patterns and idioms
- Performance optimization
- WebAssembly
- Network programming
- Real-world project implementation

## 💻 Development Workflow

1. Each topic will have its own Rust project
2. Regular commits to track progress
3. Comprehensive documentation for each concept
4. Practice exercises and mini-projects

## 🔧 Git Workflow

Quick reference for Git commands:

```bash
# Quick status check
git status

# Stage and commit in one go
git commit -am "Your message here"

# Push changes to remote
git push origin main

# Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b feature-name
```

## 📝 Progress Tracking

- Each project will have its own README
- Regular commits with meaningful messages
- Progress updates and learning notes

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Master Rust programming fundamentals
- Understand memory safety and ownership
- Build real-world applications
- Develop best practices in Rust
- Contribute to open source Rust projects
